     Release 1.04  [265087]

     Some Tkx::MegaConfig fixes by Jeff Hobbs:
       - 'METHOD' where spec would not call the documented method
       - '.' where spec didn't work at all

     Added test for Tkx::MegaConfig

     Release 1.03  [264696]

     Renamed tkxed as tkx-ed.  Jeff Hobbs made the program have a
     proper File/Edit menu and make it use the ctext widget.  There
     are also improvements to make it look nicer on Mac OS X.

     Included another sample program; tkx-prove, which allows you to
     run perl test suites in a handy window.

     Release 1.02  [186229]

     Prettier error if Tk fails to initialize.  This might happen if
     the you can't connect to the X11-server or if Tcl has been installed
     without Tk.

     Report Tcl exceptions relative to the code that uses Tkx instead of
     somewhere internally in Tcl.pm.

     Don't require style.tcl to be present for 'tkxed' and 'menu' to run.

     Improved the documentation some more.



2005-08-25   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

     Release 1.01  [182713]

     Expanded the Tkx::Tutorial.

     Added sample program called menu.

     Make the tkxed menu available with Ctrl-Button-1 on Mac OS.

     The README was not included because it was missing from the
     MANIFEST.
