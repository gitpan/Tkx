     Release 1.02  [186229]

     Prettier error if Tk fails to initialize.  This might happen if
     the you can't connect to the X11-server or if Tcl has been installed
     without Tk.

     Report Tcl exceptions relative to the code that uses Tkx instead of
     somewhere internally in Tcl.pm.

     Don't require style.tcl to be present for 'tkxed' and 'menu' to run.

     Improved the documentation some more.

     Release 1.01  [182713]

     Expanded the Tkx::Tutorial.

     Added sample program called menu.

     Make the tkxed menu available with Ctrl-Button-1 on Mac OS.

     The README was not included because it was missing from the
     MANIFEST.
